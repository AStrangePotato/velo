This project analyzes badminton smash technique improvement using computer vision. It uses MediaPipe Pose to extract and track human body landmarks from two videos, a playerâ€™s attempt and a reference model. The script normalizes body positions by centering on the hips and scaling by torso height, then compares joint movements frame-by-frame to compute average and per-joint deviations.

It aligns both videos using the loudest sound (from shuttle impact) for timing synchronization, then visualizes the comparison side by side. Each joint and limb is color-coded by deviation intensity (green = accurate, red = off), providing a visual and quantitative assessment of movement accuracy and form consistency.
